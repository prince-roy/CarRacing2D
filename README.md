# CarRacing2D

Project Description:

I have done a project named  Car Racing which is a Two Dimensional(2D) game.
 In this game, I’ve used  a programming language which is c plus plus and a library function which is glut.
The code is consist of 606 lines. We use several button to play the game which respectively represents  different task.
 SPACE >> To Start The Game.
 ESC(escape)>> To Exit From The Game.
 Up(↑) >> To Maximize Speed
Down(↓) >> To Minimize Speed.
Right(→) >>To Move Light
Left(←)>> To Move Left.
After starting the game, we use the selected button to play it. In order to score ,we need to pass the path without touching other cars. The more we pass  the path without touching  others cars, the more we score.
There are several level in it, after completing one level, we move to the next level.
If Anyone car touch the playing car,then there will be a crash and end of the game.
After playing the game, we get our obtained score.
